A good deal of real analysis is concerned with properties of scalar-valued functions
\begin{equation*}
  \map{f}{\R^{d}}{\K}, \qquad \K = \text{$\R$ or $\C$}
\end{equation*}
and with operators acting on such functions.
The one-line goal of this course is to study what happens when scalar-valued functions are replaced by \emph{Banach-valued} functions: that is, we are going to study functions
\begin{equation*}
  \map{\mb{f}}{\R^{d}}{X},
\end{equation*}
where $X$ is a Banach space, and we will study properties of operators acting on $X$-valued functions.
This will reveal interesting relationships between Fourier analysis, probability, measure theory, operator theory, and the geometry of Banach spaces.

\section{A case study: the Fourier transform and Plancherel's theorem}

To keep things simple, consider a finite-dimensional complex Banach space $X$ with a basis $\mb{e}_{1}, \ldots, \mb{e}_{N}$.
Every vector $\mb{x} \in X$ has a basis expansion
\begin{equation*}
  \mb{x} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n} \mb{e}_{n}
\end{equation*}
for some scalars $x_{n} \in \C$, so every $X$-valued function $\map{\mb{f}}{\R}{X}$ may be written as
\begin{equation*}
  \mb{f}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} f_{n}(x) \mb{e}_{n}
\end{equation*}
for some scalar-valued functions $\map{f_{n}}{\R}{\C}$.
This expansion suggests that properties of $\mb{f}$ can be deduced from properties of the scalar-valued functions $f_{n}$.

The Fourier transform is defined on integrable scalar-valued functions $f \in L^1(\R)$ by
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{f}(\xi) := \int_{\R} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, \dd x.
\end{equation*}
Plancherel's theorem, arguably the most important result in Fourier analysis, says that the Fourier transform is an isometry on $L^2$:
\begin{equation*}
  \|\hat{f}\|_{L^2(\R)} = \|f\|_{L^2(\R)}.
\end{equation*}
Does this still hold for $X$-valued functions?
Before we can answer the question we need to say what we mean by the Fourier transform and the $L^2$-norm for $X$-valued functions.
Given $\map{\mb{f}}{\R}{X}$ as above, the Fourier transform $\map{\hat{\mb{f}}}{\R}{X}$ can be defined as in the scalar-valued case: we have
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\mb{f}}(\xi)
    &:= \int_{\R} \mb{f}(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, \dd x \\
    &= \int_{\R} \Big( \sum_{n=1}^{N} f_{n}(x) \mb{e}_{n} \Big) e^{-2\pi n x \xi} \, \dd x \\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^{N} \Big(\int_{\R} f_{n}(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, \dd x \Big) \mb{e}_{n}
    &= \sum_{n=1}^{N} \hat{f_{n}}(\xi) \mb{e}_{n}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where the Lebesgue integral is extended to $X$-valued functions by linearity.\footnote{This requires finite-dimensionality of $X$. In general, the Lebesgue integral is replaced by a \emph{Bochner integral}. This is covered in Chapter \ref{sec:Bochner-spaces}.}
The $L^2$-norm on $X$-valued functions is defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \|\mb{f}\|_{L^2(\R;X)} := \Big( \int_{\R} \|\mb{f}(x)\|_{X}^{2} \, \dd x \Big)^{1/2}.
\end{equation*}
This yields a Banach space $L^2(\R;X)$, but already we start to see that something suspicious is going on: \emph{there is no natural way to turn $L^2(\R;X)$ into a Hilbert space unless $X$ itself is a Hilbert space.}
Of course, since any two norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent, there exists a constant $1 \leq C_{X} < \infty$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fd-norm-equivalence}
  C_{X}^{-1} \|(x_{n})_{n=1}^{N}\|_{\ell^2_{N}} \leq \|\mb{x}\|_{X} \leq C_{X} \|(x_{n})_{n=1}^{N}\|_{\ell^2_{N}},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \|(x_{n})_{i=1}^{N}\|_{\ell^2_{N}} := \Big( \sum_{n=1}^{N} |x_{n}|^{2} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}
is the familiar Euclidean norm on $\C^{N}$.
Since $\ell^{2}_{N}$ is a Hilbert space, \eqref{eq:fd-norm-equivalence} lets us treat $X$ as if it were a Hilbert space; the constant $C_{X}$ measures how close $X$ is to the Hilbert space $\ell^{2}_{N}$, with $C_{X} = 1$ if and only if $X$ is isometric to $\ell^{2}_{N}$.

We proceed with our investigation of the Plancherel theorem.
Using the basis expansion and the equivalence of norms in \eqref{eq:fd-norm-equivalence}, we can compute
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \|\hat{\mb{f}}\|_{L^2(\R;X)}
    &= \Big( \int_{\R} \Big\| \sum_{n=1}^{N} \hat{f_{n}}(\xi)  \mb{e}_{n} \Big\|_{X}^{2} \, \dd \xi \Big)^{1/2} \\
    &\leq C_{X} \Big( \sum_{n=1}^{N} \int_{\R} | \hat{f_{n}}(\xi) |^{2} \, \dd \xi \Big)^{1/2} \\
    &\stackrel{(*)}{=} C_{X} \Big( \sum_{n=1}^{N} \int_{\R} | f_{n}(x) |^{2} \, \dd x \Big)^{1/2} \\
    &\leq C_{X}^{2} \Big( \int_{\R} \Big\| \sum_{n=1}^{N} f_{n}(x)  \mb{e}_{n} \Big\|_{X}^{2} \Big)^{1/2} = C_{X}^{2} \|\mb{f}\|_{L^2(\R;X)},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
using the (scalar-valued) Plancherel theorem to deduce the starred equality.
Thus we do have a kind of $X$-valued Plancherel theorem, but now instead of being an isometry, the Fourier transform is merely bounded on $L^2(\R;X)$ with norm $\leq C_{X}^{2}$.
So the boundedness of the Fourier transform on $L^2(\R;X)$ seems to have something to do with the proximity of $X$ to a Hilbert space.

Now what if $X$ is infinite-dimensonal?
If a constant $C_{X}$ as in \eqref{eq:fd-norm-equivalence} exists (but with $N = \infty$), i.e. if $X$ is isomorphic to $\ell^2(\N)$, then the argument above still works,\footnote{As mentioned in an earlier footnote, the Lebesgue integral has to be replaced by the Bochner integral.} and the norm of the $X$-valued Fourier transform on $L^2(\R;X)$ is $\leq C_{X}^{2}$.
The surprising fact is that the converse is also true: we will prove this in Chapter \ref{sec:fouriertype}.

\begin{thm}[Kwapie\'n, 1972]\label{thm:Kwapien-intro}
  The $X$-valued Fourier transform is bounded on $L^2(\R;X)$ if and only if $X$ is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.
\end{thm}

This is just one (extreme) example of the following general principle: when $T$ is an operator on scalar-valued functions which is bounded on some Lebesgue space $L^p(\R)$, then $T$ can be extended to $X$-valued functions, and the boundedness of this extension on $L^p(\R;X)$ reflects geometric properties of the Banach space $X$.
Different operators (and different values of $p$) can be used to detect different geometric properties.

\section{A case study: the Hilbert transform}

One important operator in harmonic analysis is the Hilbert transform, defined on $\map{f}{\R}{\C}$ by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HT-scalar}
  Hf(x) := \mathrm{p. v.} \int_{\R} f(x-y) \, \frac{\dd y}{y} := \lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \int_{|y| > \varepsilon} f(x-y) \, \frac{\dd y}{y}.
\end{equation}
The Hilbert transform is a prototypical \emph{singular integral operator}: the integral kernel $1/y$ is not integrable, so $H$ cannot be defined as a classical integral operator, but cancellation between the positive and negative values of $1/y$ allow $Hf$ to be well-defined when $f$ is sufficiently smooth (Schwartz, for example).
One can show that $H$ is a \emph{Fourier multiplier} with symbol $m(\xi) = -i\sgn(\xi)$: that is, for all Schwartz functions $f \in \Sch(\R)$, $Hf = (m\hat{f})^{\vee}$, where $\vee$ denotes the inverse Fourier transform.
Plancherel's theorem implies that the Hilbert transform is an isometry on $L^2(\R)$: indeed,
\begin{equation*}
  \|Hf\|_{L^2(\R)} = \|m\hat{f}\|_{L^2(\R)} \leq \|m\|_{L^\infty(\R)} \|\hat{f}\|_{L^2(\R)} = \|f\|_{L^{2}(\R)},
\end{equation*}
since $|m(\xi)| = 1$ for all $\xi \in \R$.
Furthermore, since the singular kernel $1/y$ has relatively nice decay and smoothness estimates (despite its singular nature), Calder\'on--Zygmund theory can be used to extrapolate the $L^2$-boundedness to $L^p$: for $p \in (1,\infty)$ there exists a constant $C_{p} < \infty$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \|Hf\|_{L^p(\R)} \leq C_{p} \|f\|_{L^p(\R)} \qquad \forall f \in \Sch(\R).
\end{equation*}

What about vector-valued extensions?
If $X$ is a Banach space, then the $X$-valued Hilbert transform can be defined as a singular integral via the formula \eqref{eq:HT-scalar}, and it is an $X$-valued Fourier multiplier with symbol $-i\sgn(\xi)$ (using the $X$-valued Fourier transform from the previous case study).\footnote{Once more: when $X$ is infinite dimensional, Bochner integrals need to replace Lebesgue integrals!}
If $X$ is isomorphic to a Hilbert space, we can invoke the $X$-valued Plancherel theorem to estimate
\begin{equation*}
  \|H\mb{f}\|_{L^2(\R;X)} \leq K_{X} \|m\hat{\mb{f}}\|_{L^2(\R;X)} \leq K_{X} \|m\|_{L^\infty(\R)} \|\hat{\mb{f}}\|_{L^2(\R;X)}= K_{X}^{2} \|\mb{f}\|_{L^{2}(\R;X)},
\end{equation*}
where $1 \leq K_{X} < \infty$ denotes the norm of the Fourier transform on $L^2(\R;X)$.
Vector-valued Calder\'on--Zygmund methods can then be used to extrapolate this result to $L^p(\R;X)$-boundedness for all $p \in (1,\infty)$.

If $X$ is not isomorphic to a Hilbert space, then we know by Kwapie\'n's theorem that the Fourier transform is \emph{not} bounded on $L^2(\R;X)$, so the previous argument is unavailable.
However, the scalar-valued Hilbert transform is bounded on $L^p(\R)$ for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, not just $p = 2$, which suggests that boundedness of the $X$-valued Hilbert transform is a less stringent condition than the $X$-valued Plancherel theorem.
And indeed, this is the case.
We will prove the following theorem in Chapter \ref{sec:HT}.

\begin{thm}[Burkholder--Bourgain, 1983]
  The $X$-valued Hilbert transform is bounded on $L^p(\R;X)$ for some (equivalently, all) $p \in (1,\infty)$ if and only if $X$ has the \emph{UMD property}.
\end{thm}

UMD stands for Unconditionality of Martingale Differences.
Martingales are a fundamental class of stochastic processes, and unconditionality of a sequence in a Banach space says that the elements of the sequence are, in some sense, `independent' or `orthogonal'.
The UMD property is probabilistic in nature; the Burkholder--Bourgain theorem says that it is also a harmonic-analytic property.
Thus the UMD property is a natural and often necessary assumption for Banach-valued analysis.
Hilbert spaces are UMD,\footnote{The arguments above show this as a consequence of the Kwapie\'n and Burkholder--Bourgain theorems, but this is absolute overkill. It can be proven directly from the definition in terms of martingales.} but so are most natural function spaces, in particular $L^p$ spaces and Sobolev spaces $W^{p}_{s}$ (with $p \in (1,\infty)$).
Thus the UMD property appears readily in applications to PDEs, both deterministic and stochastic.
Even spaces of operators can be UMD, for example the Schatten classes $\mc{S}^{p} \subset B(H)$ (studied in Chapter \ref{sec:schatten}), and consequences of the UMD property for these spaces can be used to prove deep results in operator theory.


\section{Conventions and notation}\label{sec:conventions}
Throughout these notes we will deal with both real and complex Banach spaces.
If I do not explicitly specify `real' or `complex', then either choice can be made, and we will write $\K$ to denote the scalar field (i.e. $\K = \R$ or $\K = \C$).
Every complex Banach space can be seen as a real Banach space by restricting scalar multiplication to the reals.
On the other hand, every real Banach space can be `complexified', a process which doubles the dimension over $\R$ and does what it should: for example the complexification of $\R^n$ is $\C^n$, the complexification of $L^p(S;\R)$ is $L^p(S;\C)$, and so on.
It's a good idea not to think too hard about this.

I have tried to maintain the convention of writing vectors and vector-valued functions in bold: so I write $\mb{x} \in X$ for a vector in a Banach space $X$, and $\map{\mb{f}}{\R}{X}$ for an $X$-valued function.
This convention is not standard but I believe it helps in gaining intuition: vectors, and vector-valued functions, are intrinsically `heavier' than their scalar analogues.
This leads to some typographical paradoxes: do we consider an element of $L^2(\R)$ as a scalar-valued function (thus writing $f$) or an element of a Banach space (thus writing $\mb{f}$)?
The answer depends on the context.
I just want to point out that nobody makes this distinction in the literature (except myself, in recent papers).
Probably for good reason.


For an exponent $p \in [1,\infty]$ we let $p'$ denote the \emph{H\"older conjugate}
\begin{equation*}
  p' := \begin{cases}
    \frac{p}{p-1} & p \in (1,\infty) \\
    \infty & p = 1 \\
    1 & p = \infty,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
so that $p^{-1} + (p')^{-1} = 1$ (interpreting $1/\infty$ as $0$).

The natural numbers are $\N = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, but sometimes I will mess up and they will be $\N = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$.
